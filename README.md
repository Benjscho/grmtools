# Grammar and parsing libraries for Rust

[![Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.org/softdevteam/sparsevec.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/softdevteam/sparsevec)

grmtools is a suite of Rust libraries and binaries for parsing text, both at
compile-time, and run-time. Most users will probably be interested in the
compile-time Yacc feature, which allows traditional `.y` files to be used
(mostly) unchanged in Rust. See the
[grmtools book](https://softdevteam.github.io/grmtools/)
for more information, including a
[quickstart guide](https://softdevteam.github.io/grmtools/quickstart.html).
